# 👋 Hey there! I'm Mahek Mishra  

🎓 **Final-year MS in Computer Science @ Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning**  
💡 Passionate about **Software Engineering, Backend Systems & Machine Learning**  
💻 Ex-Intern at **Ciena, Oracle, SAP Labs**  
📊 Graduate TA for **Data & Visual Analytics**  

## 🚀 About Me  
- My coding journey began in eighth grade with Java, and I haven’t looked back since. I explored graphic design and wireframing before falling in love with software development after building my first calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Initially, I worked with large datasets, analyzing trends, which eventually led me to the world of Machine Learning, AI, Computer Vision, and NLP—where I now thrive, building impactful and scalable solutions.
- A strong believer in **tech for impact**.
- When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **curating my next Spotify Wrapped masterpiece** 🎶

## 📌 Featured Projects  
🚦 **Traffic Pulse** – Real-time **traffic forecasting & visualization** for Singapore, using **YOLO-V5** for vehicle detection in CCTV footage and **ARIMA-based forecasting models** to predict traffic congestion patterns. Built an interactive dashboard using Plotly, featuring dynamic time sliders and heatmaps for visualizing evolving traffic hotspots. Deployed the system using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes for scalable data processing.

🛒 **ShopGPT** – An **AI-powered Amazon shopping assistant** with **GPT-3.5**, enabling users to compare, summarize, and receive personalized product recommendations based on real-time scraped reviews. Engineered a prompt-based AI pipeline to generate meaningful insights, optimizing responses for user preferences. Developed a MongoDB-backed storage system to track user interactions and enhance recommendations.

🌍 **Wikidata to Wikipedia** – Developed a scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate Wikipedia articles in Indian languages using Wikidata, Llama-3.1-70B, Chroma Vector DB, and MongoDB. Designed a template-based generation approach to structure content efficiently, producing high-quality Hindi Wikipedia articles with a BERTScore F1 of 0.80. Optimized the pipeline to generate 2.3k+ token articles in ~45 seconds, outperforming Wikipedia's existing translation tools in both speed and coherence.

🖼️ iRIS – Interactive Reverse Image Search – Built a Plotly-powered dashboard that allows users to upload an image and perform reverse image search on the VisualGenome dataset. Users can interactively select nodes and edges in a scene graph, generated using the RelTR scene graph generation model, to refine their search based on object relations.

🎨 KGinPaint – AI-Powered Image Inpainting – An extension of iRIS, this tool enables users to select a node in the scene graph and remove or replace objects from an image using inpainting techniques. This project combines scene graph reasoning with image editing, allowing for context-aware modifications in images.
